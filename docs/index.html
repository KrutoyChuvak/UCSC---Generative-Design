<h2>Artist statement:</h2>
<p>This game will be made as an homage to the rogue-like genre. I'll be exploring the ideas of randomness and a never-ending game.
 I'll be seeking the emotions of chaoticness and perpetual struggle through the endless randomness of the game. </p>
<h2>A description of the experience itself:</h2>
<p>This is a 2-D top-down rpg. You start as a randomly textured character with a random name, and your only goal is to get
 deeper into the dungeon. The room you start in is random, and will connect to another random chamber. Eventually, the player
 will find the entrance to the next level, and will have to fight monsters to progress. The monsters get tougher as you move
 down in the dungeon, but there is no end. The game will be pixel art based.</p>
<h2>Technical details:</h2>
<p>This game will largely feature terrain generation. The map will be random, but specific structures and connections must be made
 between dungeon rooms. And this randomization will be different every time the game starts as well as change its shape according
 to how deep the player is in the dungeon.</p>
<h2>Schedule:</h2>
<p>Week 1: get terrain generation mostly working
Week 2: Enemy mechanics, and player movement.
Week 3: simple art, and bug fixing, and finishing touches</p>
